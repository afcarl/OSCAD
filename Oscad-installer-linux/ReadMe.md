## About

OSCAD is a free and open source EDA tool. It is created using open
source packages, such as KiCad, NgSpice, Scilab and Python. Using
OSCAD we can create circuit schematics, perform simulations and design
PCB layouts. It can create or edit new device models, and create or
edit subcircuits for simulations. It also has a Scilab based Mini
Circuit Simulator(SMCSim), which is capable of giving the circuit
equation for each simulation step. This feature is unique to OSCAD.
